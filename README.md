# scala.js playground

super simple client / server whiteboard, to play around with 
  
  * scala.js
  * http4s
  * sbt multi project (js + jvm)


# dev

        > ~; compile; re-start
        
only in the 'compile' and 'packageBin' task's the scala.js were generated FIXME: why? (hint: 'resourceGenerators')
